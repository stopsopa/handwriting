# Handwriting Tool

This project is a web-based tool that turns any text into handwriting-practice printouts. Each line of text is followed by a blank line, giving children space to copy the text exactly as it appears above. It’s designed to help them practice and improve their handwriting.

# Printing tip

Browsers don’t give full control over where page breaks occur when printing. Because of this, a line of text and its corresponding practice space (the blank area with guiding lines) may sometimes be split across two pages — which is not ideal for handwriting exercises.

To work around this, you can manually adjust the zoom level in the print dialog (e.g., Chrome’s print preview). Changing the zoom slightly can shift the content so that each text line stays together with its practice space on the same page.

The GIF below demonstrates how to adjust the zoom and find a setting that keeps the text and its corresponding practice line together.
